\arguments{
\item{touchline_length}{The entire length of the touchline (both halves).
This can be in any units, but will default to meters. Default: \code{120}}

\item{goal_line_length}{The length of the goal line. This can be in any
units, but will default to meters. Default: \code{90}}

\item{full_surf}{A boolean indicating whether or not to draw a full-surface
representation of the playing surface. Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{rotate}{A boolean indicating whether or not the surface representation
needs to be rotated. Default: \code{FALSE}}

\item{rotation_dir}{A string indicating which direction to rotate the surface
representation. Default: \code{'ccw'}}

\item{unit}{A string indicating the units with which to make the plot.
Default: \code{'m'}}

\item{background_color}{A hexadecimal string representing the color to use
for the plot's background. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to the function. These should be the
colors to pass to the \code{premier_league_features_set_colors()} function}
